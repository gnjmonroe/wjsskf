Review yesterday's upload.
- feels bland. plain is better.
  - refer to apple design guidelines for ideas/reference.
- colors are minimal but haphazard and garish.
  - use apple colors to form a color palette for now. focus on greys and pick one accent color for today.
  - It also might be worth noting that for a website, a color scheme might be more useful and accurate of a term than color palette. In my mind a color scheme is a system of color palettes, many or few, but each color palette is designed for a specific use or set of uses. It would make for a cool diagram.
- margins are too narrow.
  - I had documents' margins and spacing in mind, but i neither followed through with the rest of that typographic system nor paid much attention to anything design-oriented period.
  - webfonts and how to best implement them for performance is also something to consider.
  - refer to apple guidelines for safe zones and guidance on margins.
  - make font smaller.
  - maybe decrease font weight.
- what is XD's place in my workflow?
  - I didn't touch design software once in this entire process
  - content > HTML > design > architecture?
  - write and organize content in a markdown file first.
  - sketch rough ideas on paper; don't take too long, move to XD to flesh them out.

- what went wrong?
- what can i improve?
- what did i learn?

# reviewing yesterday's design

The design feels bland
The colors are kind of haphazard and garish
The margins (and spacing in general) feels too tight
I designed this in-browser.

Yesterday, I made a react app. I am using today's app to review, critique, and incrementally improve yesterday's design. Below are identified shortcomings and brief discussions of how to address them or how they were addressed in this design.

notes along that line:
- a lot of wasted space: the right side of the desktop view is unused and underutilized.
- spacing is too tight: margins are tight, text blocks are cramped.
- text proportions are awkward
- the color choices highlight the awkward typography.
- Arial does not work: The design feels underresolved but the use of Arial makes it feel bland.
