- glanced through the [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/design/) and [Fluent (Windows)](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/styles/web/typography) design systems.
  - [see also](https://developer.apple.com/design/tips/)
  - a lot to learn, but not enough time today. will look more thoroughly later and give them another perusal tomorrow.
  - reading them led me to think about what a platform-agnostic design system looks like, so I'll also give one of those a look tomorrow (Starbucks, MailChimp, AirBnb, etc.)
  - perhaps the biggest takeaway from reading the two design systems today is that they are mostly design specs and still leave a notable amount of leeway, at least from what I've read so far.
  - Apple minimum touch target size
    - 44pt x 44pt (59px x 59px)

    - S: 320px
    - M: 480px
    - L: 640px
    - XL: 1024px
    - XXL: 1366px

- thinking about [Practice](http://we-practice.com) again.
- and documents' highlight colors caught my eye:
  - highlight: #ade1f5
  - text: #ffffff
- as well as [NYT's maps and graphics](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/12/23/us/omicron-case-count.html).
  - particularly what worldview the color block designs illustrate and suggest.
  - what are alternative worldviews and color schemes?
- switching to markdown for pre-design (i.e., day-before) notes.
- switched from 'consolas' to 'SF mono' in VS Code.
